Configuration
-------------

To configure the plugin, make a ``albumtypes:`` section in your configuration
file. The available options are:

- **types**: An ordered list of album type to format mappings. The order of the
  mappings determines their order in the output. If a mapping is missing or
  blank, it will not be in the output.
  Default: ``[]``.
- **ignore_va**: A list of types that should not be output for Various Artists
  albums. Useful for not adding redundant information - various artist albums
  are often compilations.
  Default: ``[]``.
- **bracket**: Defines the brackets to enclose each album type in the output.
  Default: ``'[]'``
